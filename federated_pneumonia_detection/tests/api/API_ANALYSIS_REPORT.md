# API Endpoint Structure Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

The API endpoints have been scanned and tested for structural alignment with business logic. **13 critical issues** were identified that need resolution before full integration with Copilot Kit.

## Test Results

- **Total Tests**: 39
- **Passed**: 26 âœ“
- **Failed**: 13 âœ—
- **Pass Rate**: 66.7%

## Critical Issues Found

### 1. **ModuleNotFoundError: federated_learning.federated_trainer** (Blocker)
**Severity**: CRITICAL  
**Status**: Blocking all comparison endpoint tests

The import path in `comparison_endpoints.py` is incorrect:
```python
# CURRENT (WRONG):
from federated_pneumonia_detection.src.control.federated_learning.federated_trainer import FederatedTrainer
```

**Evidence**: Multiple test failures across comparison endpoints and import tests
- `TestBusinessLogicAlignment::test_experiment_orchestrator_import_available` FAILED
- `TestZipFileHandling::test_comparison_endpoint_extracts_zip_correctly` FAILED
- `TestBackgroundTaskHandling::test_endpoints_use_background_tasks` FAILED

**Root Cause**: The module structure doesn't match the import path. Need to verify actual location of FederatedTrainer class.

**Action Required**: 
1. Locate the correct import path for FederatedTrainer
2. Update imports in `comparison_endpoints.py` and `experiment_orchestrator.py`
3. Ensure module structure aligns with imports

---

### 2. **Missing batch_size in ExperimentConfig Schema** (High)
**Severity**: HIGH  
**Status**: Configuration incomplete

The ExperimentConfig schema in `schemas.py` is missing the `batch_size` field even though it's used in the system.

**Evidence**: 
- `TestConfigurationEndpoint::test_experiment_config_schema_includes_standard_params` FAILED

**Impact**: Users cannot configure batch_size through the API configuration endpoint, though it's available in the system.

**Action Required**:
Add to `federated_pneumonia_detection/src/api/endpoints/configruation_settings/schemas.py`:
```python
batch_size: Optional[int] = Field(None, description="Batch size for training")
```

---

### 3. **Endpoints Not Registered with FastAPI Router** (High)
**Severity**: HIGH  
**Status**: Endpoints not discoverable

The experiment endpoints exist but their routes are not being returned by FastAPI router inspection.

**Evidence**:
- `TestEndpointStructure::test_experiment_endpoints_exist` FAILED
- `TestFederatedEndpoint::test_federated_train_endpoint_exists` FAILED
- `TestCentralizedEndpoint::test_centralized_train_endpoint_exists` FAILED
- `TestComparisonEndpoint::test_comparison_endpoint_exists` FAILED

**Root Cause**: The endpoints are defined with decorators but may not be properly included in `main.py`

**Action Required**:
1. Verify that `main.py` includes all endpoint routers
2. Check that routers are included with correct prefix
3. Ensure `include_router()` calls are present for all endpoints

**Expected in main.py**:
```python
from federated_pneumonia_detection.src.api.endpoints.experiments import (
    centralized_endpoints,
    federated_endpoints,
    comparison_endpoints,
)
from federated_pneumonia_detection.src.api.endpoints.configruation_settings import (
    configuration_endpoints,
)

app.include_router(configuration_endpoints.router)
app.include_router(centralized_endpoints.router)
app.include_router(federated_endpoints.router)
app.include_router(comparison_endpoints.router)
```

---

### 4. **Typo in Folder Name** (Medium)
**Severity**: MEDIUM  
**Status**: Naming convention issue

The folder is named `configruation_settings` (typo) instead of `configuration_settings`.

**Evidence**:
- `TestNamingConventions::test_typo_in_configuration_endpoint_folder` PASSED (but confirms issue)
- File path: `federated_pneumonia_detection/src/api/endpoints/configruation_settings/`

**Impact**: Code readability, potential confusion, inconsistent with naming conventions

**Action Required**:
1. Rename folder from `configruation_settings` â†’ `configuration_settings`
2. Update all imports throughout codebase
3. Update import in `main.py`

**Affected Files**:
- `federated_pneumonia_detection/src/api/endpoints/configruation_settings/__init__.py`
- `federated_pneumonia_detection/src/api/endpoints/configruation_settings/configuration_endpoints.py`
- `federated_pneumonia_detection/src/api/endpoints/configruation_settings/schemas.py`

---

### 5. **Missing Implementation: logging_endpoints.py** (Medium)
**Severity**: MEDIUM  
**Status**: Not implemented

The file `results/logging_endpoints.py` exists but is empty with no router implementation.

**Evidence**:
- `TestNamingConventions::test_logging_endpoints_implementation_missing` PASSED (documents issue)
- File: `federated_pneumonia_detection/src/api/endpoints/results/logging_endpoints.py`

**Impact**: Users cannot retrieve training logs via API

**Action Required**:
Either:
1. **Implement logging endpoints** with routes to fetch:
   - Live training logs
   - Historical logs by run ID
   - Log filtering/pagination
   
2. **Or remove** if not needed, and update documentation

---

### 6. **Missing Implementation: results_endpoints.py** (Medium)
**Severity**: MEDIUM  
**Status**: Not implemented

The file `results/results_endpoints.py` exists but is empty with no router implementation.

**Evidence**:
- `TestNamingConventions::test_results_endpoints_implementation_missing` PASSED (documents issue)
- File: `federated_pneumonia_detection/src/api/endpoints/results/results_endpoints.py`

**Impact**: Users cannot retrieve experiment results via API

**Action Required**:
Either:
1. **Implement results endpoints** with routes to:
   - Fetch results by run ID
   - List all results
   - Get metrics/artifacts
   - Export results
   
2. **Or remove** if not needed, and update documentation

---

## Structural Overview (What's Working)

### âœ“ Properly Implemented

1. **Configuration Endpoint Structure**
   - Endpoint exists and is routed correctly to `/configuration`
   - Schema is comprehensive with all configuration sections
   - Federated learning parameters are included
   - `get_config` dependency injection is set up

2. **Dependency Injection (deps.py)**
   - All required dependencies are properly exported:
     - `get_db()` - Database session
     - `get_config()` - Configuration manager
     - `get_experiment_crud()` - Experiment CRUD operations
     - `get_run_configuration_crud()` - Run config CRUD
     - `get_run_metric_crud()` - Metrics CRUD
     - `get_run_artifact_crud()` - Artifacts CRUD

3. **Business Logic Integration**
   - CentralizedTrainer is properly imported and used
   - FederatedTrainer is properly imported in federated endpoints
   - Background tasks are correctly configured
   - ZIP file extraction is implemented consistently

4. **Error Handling**
   - All training endpoints have try-catch blocks
   - Exceptions are logged with full tracebacks
   - Cleanup of temp directories is handled

5. **API Settings**
   - Settings class properly configured
   - Reasonable defaults provided

## Recommendations for Copilot Kit Integration

### Phase 1: Fix Critical Issues
1. Resolve FederatedTrainer import path issue
2. Register all endpoint routers in `main.py`
3. Add batch_size to configuration schema
4. Rename `configruation_settings` folder

### Phase 2: Implement Missing Endpoints
1. Implement logging endpoints for real-time log access
2. Implement results endpoints for retrieving experiment data
3. Add WebSocket support for live training updates (streaming logs to Copilot UI)

### Phase 3: Copilot Kit Integration
Once core API is functional, integrate with Copilot Kit:

```
React Copilot Kit UI
        â†“
Copilot Kit Library
        â†“
FastAPI Backend
â”œâ”€â”€ /configuration/* - Configure experiments
â”œâ”€â”€ /experiments/* - Start/monitor training
â”œâ”€â”€ /results/* - Retrieve results
â””â”€â”€ /logs/* - Stream live logs
```
