System Overview
This federated learning system implements a pneumonia detection model using the Flower framework. The system consists of five main components that work together to orchestrate distributed training across multiple clients while maintaining data privacy.

Main Components Deep Analysis
1. FederatedTrainer - The Central Orchestrator
Role: Main entry point and workflow coordinator for the entire federated learning process.

Configuration Loading (Answer to Question 1):

Uses ConfigLoader with optional config_path parameter in __init__

Fallback mechanism: If config loading fails, uses default configurations

Configuration Elements Used: num_clients, num_rounds, clients_per_round, local_epochs, learning_rate, batch_size, seed

Constants Used: PATIENT_ID_COLUMN, TARGET_COLUMN

Key Methods:

train(): Main workflow orchestrator that handles data extraction, partitioning, and simulation setup

_partition_data_for_clients(): Delegates data partitioning using different strategies

_run_federated_simulation(): Currently a placeholder for Flower simulation setup

2. ServerApp - Global Model Coordinator
Role: Flower federated learning server that manages the global model and orchestrates training rounds.

Configuration Loading:

Uses ConfigLoader with hardcoded config directory path: "federated_pneumonia_detection/config"

Loads both SystemConstants and ExperimentConfig

Runtime overrides: Accepts configuration updates from Flower context

Communication Protocol:

Sends to clients: Model weights via ArrayRecord messages + training config via ConfigRecord

Receives from clients: Updated weights (ArrayRecord) + metrics (MetricRecord)

Aggregation: Uses FedAvg strategy for model weight aggregation

3. ClientApp - Local Training Executor
Role: Flower federated learning client that performs local training on data partitions.

Configuration Loading:

Uses ConfigLoader with hardcoded path: "federated_pneumonia_detection/config"

Configuration Elements Used: num_classes, dropout_rate, fine_tune_layers_count, local_epochs, learning_rate, weight_decay

Local Training Process (Answer to Question 2):

Training happens in: @app.train() decorated function

Training execution: Calls TrainingFunctions.train_one_epoch()

Training loop: Uses model.train(), optimizer.step(), and criterion() for loss calculation

Current status: Template implementation - actual data loading needs to be implemented

4. TrainingFunctions - Pure PyTorch Training Logic
Role: Provides PyTorch training utilities without Lightning for Flower compatibility.

Core Training Functions:

train_one_epoch(): Main training loop with forward pass, loss calculation, and backpropagation

evaluate_model(): Validation/evaluation with metrics calculation

get_model_parameters() / set_model_parameters(): Parameter serialization for Flower communication

5. DataPartitioner - Data Distribution Manager
Role: Handles data splitting across federated clients with different strategies.

Partitioning Strategies:

IID: partition_data_iid() - Random equal distribution

Non-IID: partition_data_by_patient() - Patient-based separation (realistic for medical data)

Stratified: partition_data_stratified() - Class-balanced distribution

Communication Flow (Answer to Question 3)
The client-server communication happens through Flower's message passing framework:

Server â†’ Client Communication:
Model Weights: ArrayRecord(model.state_dict())

Training Configuration: ConfigRecord({"lr": learning_rate})

Message Structure: Message objects with structured content

Client â†’ Server Communication:
Updated Weights: ArrayRecord(updated_model.state_dict())

Training Metrics: MetricRecord({"train_loss": float, "num_examples": int})

Evaluation Metrics: MetricRecord({"eval_loss": float, "eval_acc": float})

Communication Protocol:
ServerApp sends initial model weights and config to clients

ClientApp receives weights, loads them into local model

ClientApp performs local training using TrainingFunctions

ClientApp sends updated weights and metrics back to server

ServerApp aggregates weights using FedAvg strategy

Process repeats for configured number of rounds

Results Output (Answer to Question 4)
Training Outputs:
Model Checkpoints: Saved to configurable checkpoint directory (federated_checkpoints by default)

Final Model: torch.save() to federated_final_model.pt in ServerApp

Training Logs: Comprehensive logging throughout workflow via Python logging

Results Structure:
python
results = {
    'experiment_name': experiment_name,
    'num_clients': config.num_clients,
    'num_rounds': config.num_rounds,
    'partition_strategy': partition_strategy,
    'checkpoint_dir': checkpoint_dir,
    'logs_dir': logs_dir,
    'status': 'template_implementation'
}
Experiment Tracking:
Partition Statistics: Client data distribution logging

Configuration Logging: Full parameter set documentation

Metrics: Training/validation loss and accuracy per round

Error Handling: Comprehensive exception logging

Training Workflow Analysis
The complete training workflow follows this sequence:

Initialization: FederatedTrainer.__init__ loads configuration via ConfigLoader

Data Loading: FederatedTrainer.train() extracts/finds dataset using ZipHandler/DirectoryHandler

Data Partitioning: Uses DataPartitioner functions based on selected strategy

Server Setup: ServerApp.main() initializes global model and FedAvg strategy

Client Setup: ClientApp instances receive partition assignments

Local Training: TrainingFunctions.train_one_epoch() performs actual training

Parameter Exchange: Flower framework handles message passing

Model Aggregation: ServerApp FedAvg strategy aggregates weights

Results Output: Final model saved to checkpoint directory

Current Implementation Status
âœ… Completed Components:
Full architecture and class structure

Configuration management system

Data partitioning utilities

Flower client/server app templates

Pure PyTorch training functions

ðŸš§ Template/Placeholder Elements:
Data Loading: Actual client data partition loading needs implementation

Flower Simulation: Complete simulation setup with client functions in FederatedTrainer._run_federated_simulation()

Results Integration: Full metrics aggregation and visualization

Key Integration Points
Configuration Flow: ConfigLoader â†’ FederatedTrainer â†’ ServerApp/ClientApp

Data Flow: FederatedTrainer â†’ DataPartitioner â†’ Client data partitions

Training Flow: ClientApp â†’ TrainingFunctions â†’ Model updates

Communication Flow: Flower Messages between ServerApp â†” ClientApp

Results Flow: Training metrics â†’ Server aggregation â†’ Final model checkpoint

This architecture provides a solid foundation for federated learning with clear separation of concerns, comprehensive configuration management, and extensible design for production deployment. The system is currently in a template state where the core structure is complete but requires implementation of actual data loading and complete Flower simulation setup.
