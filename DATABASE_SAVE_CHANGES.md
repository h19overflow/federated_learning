# Database Results Save Implementation - Changes Summary

## What Was Added

A complete database persistence layer has been added to save training results after the trainer completes. This includes a new method in `TrainerBuilder` and integration into the `CentralizedTrainer` workflow.

## Files Modified

### 1. `trainer_builder.py`
**Location:** `federated_pneumonia_detection/src/control/dl_model/utils/data/trainer_builder.py`

**New Method Added: `save_results_to_db()`** (Lines 147-241)

This method:
- Takes trained trainer, model, and experiment_id as inputs
- Creates a Run record in the database
- Saves hyperparameter configuration (learning_rate, epochs, batch_size, weight_decay, seed)
- Saves final validation metrics
- Saves best model checkpoint artifact
- Handles both centralized and federated configs (federated fields optional)
- Returns the created run_id
- Includes complete error handling with transaction rollback

**New Imports Added:**
```python
from typing import Optional  # Already existed, added Optional to it
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
from federated_pneumonia_detection.src.boundary.CRUD.run import run_crud
from federated_pneumonia_detection.src.boundary.CRUD.run_configuration import run_configuration_crud
from federated_pneumonia_detection.src.boundary.CRUD.run_metric import run_metric_crud
from federated_pneumonia_detection.src.boundary.CRUD.run_artifact import run_artifact_crud
from federated_pneumonia_detection.src.boundary.engine import get_session
from datetime import datetime
```

### 2. `centralized_trainer.py`
**Location:** `federated_pneumonia_detection/src/control/dl_model/centralized_trainer.py`

**New Step in `train()` method** (Lines 200-227)

After Step 6 (collecting results), a new database save step has been added:

1. Gets existing experiment by name, or creates new one if not found
2. Calls `trainer_builder.save_results_to_db()` with:
   - trainer (the trained PyTorch Lightning trainer)
   - model (the trained LitResNet model)
   - experiment_id (from the experiment record)
   - training_mode set to "centralized"
   - source_path (the data source)
3. Adds the returned `run_id` to results dictionary
4. Has graceful error handling - if database save fails, training still succeeds with a warning

**New Imports Added:**
```python
from federated_pneumonia_detection.src.boundary.CRUD.experiment import experiment_crud
from federated_pneumonia_detection.src.boundary.engine import get_session
```

## Workflow

### Before (Old)
```
Step 1: Extract & validate data
Step 2: Load & process dataset
Step 3: Create data module
Step 4: Build model & callbacks
Step 5: Create trainer
Step 6: Train model
       ↓
Collect results
       ↓
Return results
```

### After (New)
```
Step 1: Extract & validate data
Step 2: Load & process dataset
Step 3: Create data module
Step 4: Build model & callbacks
Step 5: Create trainer
Step 6: Train model
       ↓
Collect results
       ↓
Step 7: Save results to database ← NEW
         ├─ Create/Get experiment
         ├─ Create Run record
         ├─ Save RunConfiguration
         ├─ Save RunMetrics
         └─ Save RunArtifacts
       ↓
Return results (with run_id)
```

## Database Records Created

When `save_results_to_db()` is called, the following database records are created:

### 1. Run Record
- experiment_id: Reference to the experiment
- training_mode: "centralized" or "federated"
- status: "completed"
- start_time: Training start timestamp
- end_time: Training end timestamp
- source_path: Path to training data

### 2. RunConfiguration Record
- learning_rate: From config
- epochs: From config
- batch_size: From config
- weight_decay: From config
- seed: From config
- num_clients: Optional (federated)
- num_rounds: Optional (federated)
- local_epochs: Optional (federated)

### 3. RunMetric Records (Multiple)
- One record per validation metric
- metric_name: Name of the metric (e.g., "val_accuracy", "val_loss")
- metric_value: Final metric value
- step: Global training step
- dataset_type: "validation"

### 4. RunArtifact Record
- artifact_name: "best_model"
- artifact_path: Path to best model checkpoint
- artifact_type: "model"

## Error Handling

The implementation is designed to be non-blocking:

- If database operations fail, a warning is logged but training continues
- Transactions are properly rolled back on error
- Database sessions are always cleaned up
- Training completion is not affected by database save failures
- Errors are logged with full context (error type and message)

## Return Value

After database save completes, the results dictionary includes a new key:
```python
results = trainer.train(...)
print(results['run_id'])  # Database ID of the created run
```

## Compatibility

✓ Works with centralized training
✓ Compatible with federated training (optional fields handled)
✓ Uses existing CRUD operations (no new database code needed)
✓ Follows existing code patterns
✓ Properly typed with type hints
✓ Includes comprehensive logging

## Testing

Both files have been verified to:
- Have valid Python syntax (py_compile check passed)
- Import correctly (manual import test passed)
- Methods are discoverable (grep verification passed)

## Ready for Integration

The implementation is complete and ready for:
- Direct use in centralized training workflows
- Similar implementation in federated trainer
- Frontend integration to display saved run data
- Database queries to retrieve training history
