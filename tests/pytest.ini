markers =
    unit: Unit tests that test individual components in isolation
    integration: Integration tests that test component interactions
    slow: Tests that take more than a few seconds to run
    gpu: Tests that require GPU hardware
    federated: Tests specific to federated learning functionality
    phase1: Tests for Phase 1 components (entities, data processing)
    phase2: Tests for Phase 2 components (models, training)
    phase3: Tests for Phase 3 components (centralized training)
    phase4: Tests for Phase 4 components (dashboard)
    phase5: Tests for Phase 5 components (federated learning)
